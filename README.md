This is a repository created to compile vocabulary from Duolingo's Greek tree. The words within are to be listed as tab-delimited vocabulary, that is to say, a word in greek, followed by a tab, followed by the meaning in English.. The use case for this list is easy importation into space-repetition learning applications such as Anki etc. and is designed to complement study of Greek on Duolingo itself

* In the "list.txt" file different lesson categories are to be separated by a # and the name of the lesson category, for easy removal when imported
* The "list-flat.txt" file is automatically generated by the script output-flat.sh and removes all the lines starting with # for easier import into flashcard applications
* In some cases an entry as a phrase rather than a single word will be appropriate
* When possible include the gender of the noun or add it to previously added entries which still lack them to improve the list
* If grammar notes are useful and can be easily made into a flashcard, feel free to incorporate them
* Grammatical points may work better with English in the first field (question) and Greek in the second (answer)
* Please do not make separate entries for every conjugation of a word. 
* Keep definitions simple, short, and clear as much as possible
* Do not word for word copy long definitions from copyrighted dictionaries when contributing
